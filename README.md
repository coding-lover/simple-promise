Promise
=======

A lightweight implementation of [CommonJS Promises/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A) for PHP.

It also provides several other useful promise-related concepts, such as joining multiple promises and mapping and reducing collections of promises.

This file mostly code come from [react/promise](https://github.com/reactphp/promise), thanks reactphp Team provide such a useful package.

Concepts
--------

### Deferred

A **Deferred** represents a computation or unit of work that may not have
completed yet. Typically (but not always), that computation will be something
that executes asynchronously and completes at some point in the future.

### Promise

While a deferred represents the computation itself, a **Promise** represents
the result of that computation. Thus, each deferred has a promise that acts as
a placeholder for its actual result.

API
---

### Deferred

A deferred represents an operation whose resolution is pending. It has separate
promise and resolver parts.

```php
$deferred = new React\Promise\Deferred();

$promise = $deferred->promise();

$deferred->resolve(mixed $value = null);
$deferred->reject(mixed $reason = null);
```

### How promise forwarding works

A few simple examples to show how the mechanics of Promises/A forwarding works.
These examples are contrived, of course, and in real usage, promise chains will
typically be spread across several function calls, or even several levels of
your application architecture.

#### Resolution forwarding

Resolved promises forward resolution values to the next promise.
The first promise, `$deferred->promise()`, will resolve with the value passed
to `$deferred->resolve()` below.

Each call to `then()` returns a new promise that will resolve with the return
value of the previous handler. This creates a promise "pipeline".

```php
$deferred = new React\Promise\Deferred();

$deferred->promise()
    ->then(function ($x) {
        // $x will be the value passed to $deferred->resolve() below
        // and returns a *new promise* for $x + 1
        return $x + 1;
    })
    ->then(function ($x) {
        // $x === 2
        // This handler receives the return value of the
        // previous handler.
        return $x + 1;
    })
    ->then(function ($x) {
        // $x === 3
        // This handler receives the return value of the
        // previous handler.
        return $x + 1;
    })
    ->then(function ($x) {
        // $x === 4
        // This handler receives the return value of the
        // previous handler.
        echo 'Resolve ' . $x;
    });

$deferred->resolve(1); // Prints "Resolve 4"
```

#### Rejection forwarding

Rejected promises behave similarly, and also work similarly to try/catch:
When you catch an exception, you must rethrow for it to propagate.

Similarly, when you handle a rejected promise, to propagate the rejection,
"rethrow" it by either returning a rejected promise, or actually throwing
(since promise translates thrown exceptions into rejections)

```php
$deferred = new React\Promise\Deferred();

$deferred->promise()
    ->then(function ($x) {
        throw new \Exception($x + 1);
    })
    ->otherwise(function (\Exception $x) {
        // Propagate the rejection
        throw $x;
    })
    ->otherwise(function (\Exception $x) {
        // Can also propagate by returning another rejection
        return React\Promise\reject(
            new \Exception($x->getMessage() + 1)
        );
    })
    ->otherwise(function ($x) {
        echo 'Reject ' . $x->getMessage(); // 3
    });

$deferred->resolve(1);  // Prints "Reject 3"
```
